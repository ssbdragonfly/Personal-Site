    <p><b><i>Tray API</i></b> is an advanced food image classification tool for mantaining modeled/classified features
      about food images. I developed a simple convolutional neural network for 12 classes of food. I have a nice website
      I worked on a lot(check out the video) powered by typical Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, and JS. It also includes the
      integration of a helpful gemini powered chatbot to assist users with queries about the API (Interesting learning
      prompt engineering). I am currently working on enhancing it with a cuisine detector, a nutrition model, and a more
      specific image classifier. These new models are in development, focusing on providing detailed and precise food
      classification capabilities including cuisine classification and nutrition modeling. Inspired the issue of bad
      free modeling APIs for these tasks when devoloping <a class="Expire-E" href="Expire-E.html">Expire-E</a>.
