    <p><b><i>K9Shield</i></b> was the first free canine disease diagnosis application. My team and I created it during
      HackTJ(one of the largest in-person high schooler run hackathons, over 500 students, I am now a part of <15 person
        team running it). It uses Machine Learning image classification and algorathimic processes to diagnose risk
        factors for canine diseases. Sidh: Right now, there are 471 million pet canines, and yet, no method exists for
        their immediate health classification. This application is a step in the right direction, and will help pet
        owners and veterinarians to better understand using software to help canines. The project was even endorsed by a
        local veterinarian! </p>
